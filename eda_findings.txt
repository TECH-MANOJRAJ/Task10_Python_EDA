EDA Findings – Task 10

1. The dataset contains multiple features related to student performance such as math, reading, and writing scores.

2. Basic exploration using shape, info, and head helped understand the structure and data types of the dataset.

3. Descriptive statistics showed the range, mean, and distribution of numeric columns.

4. Missing value percentage was calculated and no major missing values were found in key score columns.

5. Histogram and boxplot of math score revealed the distribution and presence of extreme values.

6. Outliers were detected using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.

7. An outlier flag column was created to identify records with outlier values.

8. Outliers were handled using the capping method instead of removing them to avoid losing useful information.

9. Correlation matrix showed strong positive correlation between math score, reading score, and writing score.

10. The cleaned dataset was exported successfully for further analysis or modeling.
