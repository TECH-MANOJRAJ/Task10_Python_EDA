Task 10: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Outlier Detection

Project Overview:
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and detecting outliers in a dataset using Python. The objective is to understand the data distribution, identify anomalies, and prepare a cleaned dataset suitable for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

Methodology:
- Imported the dataset using pandas and examined its structure using shape, info, and head.
- Generated descriptive statistics to summarize central tendency and spread of numeric features.
- Calculated missing value percentages to assess data quality.
- Visualized data distributions using histograms and boxplots for better interpretation.
- Detected outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- Created an outlier indicator column to flag anomalous records.
- Handled outliers using the capping technique to reduce their impact without removing valid observations.
- Computed the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical variables.
- Exported the cleaned dataset for downstream analysis.

Repository Contents:
- task10_eda.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA and outlier detection workflow.
- cleaned_dataset.csv : Dataset after outlier handling and preprocessing.
- eda_findings.txt : Summary of insights derived from the analysis.
- README.md : Project documentation.

Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Outcome:
The project demonstrates a structured approach to data exploration and anomaly detection. The resulting cleaned dataset provides improved data quality and can be directly used for predictive modeling or business analysis.
